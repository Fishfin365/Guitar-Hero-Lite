This Guitar Hero code mimics the keys played on your keyboard and "plucks" a guitar string sound 

valid inputs are: q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=zxdcfvgbnjmk,.;/'
these keys are like a keyboard with q to [ being white keys on a piano.  numbers 2,4,5,7,8,9 and - = keys being black notes on a piano.

the file to run to make the sounds is the GuitarHero.java
the file RingBuffer.java simulates the sound picth with the inputted frequency
the file GuitarString.java will do the math with what key is pressed to make it so it tells ring buffer the right frequency, and how long the sound should play
GuitarHeroLite is just using the a and c keys to test/learn how to make the ringbuffer and guitar string to work
